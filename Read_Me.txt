OUR PROJECT

OUR_FUNCTIONS
- our_functions contains all the functions so far
- If you think we need to structure it differently
	functions in several files or subfolder
	I should now know how to do it.

- Maybe we can agree on updating this file with functions every x days
	so that we keep an overview
	I would also prefer not to put work in progress in there but only perfectly working and needed functions
	

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
- my start on some descriptive analysis
- I will maybe just include the results in a document and write sth about it if you think this might be a good idea??
- There is the time-stamp of tweets and also one including events as well but just for April 2016, this should be
	relatively easy to extent.

190503... FILE
- Sina and I started on some tokenization
- I also created columns for the "@" and hashtags
- Should we create a dummy column indicating retweet or discard retweets or treat them as normal tweets???

NETWORK
- there are two approaches for creating a network
- both of them are more or less copied from Kaggle.
- The second one gives slightly different results because it also considers mentions out of the dataset
- @Zeyu maybe you can check out the 2nd variant in more detail and see if it has any aspects you think are important
	to incorporate in our baseline network.
